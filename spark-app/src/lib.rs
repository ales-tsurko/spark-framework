//! This library contains abstractions to implement an application with a state manager, editing
//! history (undo/redo), hotkeys manager, settings manager, etc. It doesn't dependent on any GUI
//! framework. It's event-based â€” every change of a state is represented by a particular type, which
//! implements [`state::Change`](crate::state::Change).
